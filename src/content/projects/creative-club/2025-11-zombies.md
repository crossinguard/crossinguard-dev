## About my autumn silhouette project

Our theme this month is "Zombies".

Some other projects (that I also procrastinated) ended up taking priority so this was a mad scramble at the end. As I was settling into the theme, a zombie-based adventure from my past sprung to mind. 

The first house I shared with my wife was also shared with various friends and family across the time we lived there. While the house we rented was cheap, the state of the house matched the price. The first level was sunk into a hill, making it partially underground, and the second level (which included the main entrance) nicely overlooked the sloped hills leading up to us. We realized that if/when a zombie outbreak took place, this house was a pretty decent setup to survive the undead. And with that, ZP Day was born.

ZP Day (Zombie Prep Day) took place on October 13, 2012. For 24 hours (I think...I can't remember), we locked outselves in the first floor of the house, "barricaded" the exits/windows, and waited out the zombie apocalypse. We were so dedicated that when my out-of-state parents dropped by for a surprise visit, we refused to open the barricades to let them in. They claimed they weren't bit, but they always say that.

Our prep included a rough sketch on some cardboard with the first floor layout along with needed fortifications. I found an old picture of ZP day and decided to recreate that sketch for my project this month.

## How I made it

This one wasn't too tricky. I took my reference photo into Procreate and sketched out a new version. I tried to not "upgrade" it too much as I was more interested in a recreation than an adaptation.

My handwritting hasn't changed at all.
